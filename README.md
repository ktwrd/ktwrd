"full-stack" javascript software developer w/ 4 years of full-time javascript development (started "full-time" in early 2018) as my main langauge and 7 years of mixed knowledge of other langauges (first proper langauge I learned was PHP in 2014, started using it heavily in 2015 and stopped in 2019).

currently i'm working for a mining company developing software using the MEVN/SEVN stack (mongodb/sqlite, electron, vue.js, node.js) since dec 2021. not saying where because there are creepy ppl on the internet.

	<summary><strong>project prefrences</strong></summary>
	<p>
	when working with web-based projects it depends on what it is, if it's a program that turns data into another form of data or visualises that data there is a very high chance i won't be using a langauge like php. below this is my current prefrences (frameworks/langauges) for what type of application i want to make. currently, i perfer the GNU LGPLv3 license compared to the license i was using for nearly all of my projects (GPL2.0/3.0). You can compare those changes by googling those licenses.
