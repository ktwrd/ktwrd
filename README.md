### Just your local transfem C# Full-Stack Developer. Tinkering away at work and occasionally working on personal projects.

Sometimes I tinker around with reverse engineering stuff and working on multiple projects;

  - SQL Server 201x maintaince
  - Creation and maintainence of many internal tools
    - All internal tools are written with C#

If you wish to see my full-ish portfolio, [then check it out on my website](https://kate.pet/p/portfolio)!

You can find me on various platforms, which can all be found on my [homepage](https://kate.pet/p/links).

**NOTE:** My GitHub contribution graph is kinda misleading for how much programming I do outside of work. A lot of the current projects I work on aren't on GitHub, and are either on my employers (private) git instance, the Open Fortress GitLab, or my own self-hosted Gitea instance.
